This designed analysis tool is aimed to simulate the workload on a supercomputer and to produce job traces for a given workload, as well, it is used for the quantitative model validation and adjustment. There are two modes to run the simulator: i) set operational parameters, such as job generation rate and job execution rate, to produce synthetic data only; ii) use historical data for key parameters of the job, such as timestamp of job arrival to the queue and job execution time, to produce simulated data of real job processing life-cycle.

The simulator is based on Queueing Theory~\cite{ref-queueing-theory} and according to the Kendall's Notation~\cite{ref-kendall} for queues, usually referred as A/B/C/D/E, it is characterized as following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A - \textit{arrival process} is represented by streams that are responsible for job generation and is described either by a Poisson process or by a deterministic model;
    \item B - \textit{service/server process} is represented by a set of nodes that simulate job execution process and is described either by a Poisson process or by a deterministic model as well;
    \item C - \textit{number of servers} that corresponds to the number of computing nodes (in terms of the Titan supercomputer);
    \item D - \textit{capacity of the queue or system overall}, which is ``on'', if the queue limit is set (either per stream or for the total number of jobs in the queue) and queue buffer is not used, otherwise the capacity is unlimited;
    \item E - \textit{queueing discipline} is provided in two options: FIFO or Priority.
\end{itemize}

Some of the parameters are set as requirements and restrictions applied to a specific supercomputer and its policy, e.g., the total number of computing nodes that are available for computing jobs, the limit of the number of jobs in the queue per user/group, etc.

\subsubsection{Simulator description} \label{sec-strategy-3-1}

Implementation of the simulator (Queueing System Simulator) \cite{ref-qss} was done by using Python\footnote{High-level programming language Python, \url{https://docs.python.org/2.7/} [accessed on 2019-04-15]}, and the following key classes and generators were designed (to emulate internal supercomputer processes): 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Job} - contains parameters to describe job's processing life-cycle, such as arrival timestamp, start execution timestamp, completion timestamp that is based on walltime / execution time along with the previous parameter, number of required nodes for its execution, stream (i.e., source name), label (i.e., project name), priority and priority group name;
    \item \textit{Stream} - generates jobs with the predefined parameters as an input for the simulator;
    \item \textit{Queue Manager} - emulates buffer ahead of the queue, the queue itself, and manages jobs while waiting for their execution, it lets to define the queue discipline such as FIFO and Priority, and set the limits per input job stream;
    \item \textit{Schedule Manager} - emulates a backfill mode - gets information about job sizes, assigns corresponding nodes for execution, gives a schedule when each job starts to be executed;
    \item \textit{QSS} - the core class that manages and tracks job's processing life-cycle.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{State model} \label{sec-strategy-3-2}

Job life-cycle (in terms of the simulator, Figure~\ref{fig-simulator-scheme}) includes the following states: Generated - Holding (i.e., Titan notation: blocked) [buffer] - Pending (i.e., Titan notation: eligible-to-run) [queue] - Starting - Executing - Finished. Some of the states might be skipped if certain components are turned off (e.g., if the queue buffer is not used then there is no state ``holding'') or if there is some initial restriction (e.g., state ``starting'' is neglected, since the assumption that job execution starts right after it leaves the queue).

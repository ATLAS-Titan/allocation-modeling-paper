Developed tools provide possibility to adjust jobs parameters to regulate and improve the probability of utilizing a given allocation for a given project. Further work for the proposed approach improvement includes reinforcement of applied requirements (i.e., decrease the number of applied assumptions for the developed model and simulator). The model and simulator are preliminary and require further tuning, to understand the accuracy and sensitivity (to initial conditions, training duration, workload types). This early work will be extended to consider different kinds of workflows as well as different types of workloads of heterogeneous resources.
